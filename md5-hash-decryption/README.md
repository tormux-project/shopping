# Md5 Hash Decryption

The `MD5 message-digest algorithm` is a cryptographically broken but still widely used hash function producing a `128-bit hash` value. Although MD5 was initially designed to be used as a cryptographic hash function, it has been found to suffer from extensive vulnerabilities. It can still be used as a checksum to verify data integrity, but only against unintentional corruption. It remains suitable for other non-cryptographic purposes, for example for determining the partition for a particular key in a partitioned database, and may be preferred due to lower computational requirements than more recent Secure Hash Algorithms. MD5 was designed by `Ronald Rivest` in 1991 to replace an earlier hash function MD4, and was specified in 1992 as RFC 1321. One basic requirement of any cryptographic hash function is that it should be computationally infeasible to find two distinct messages that hash to the same value
